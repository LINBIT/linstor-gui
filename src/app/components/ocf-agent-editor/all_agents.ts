          'Usually a SAP system consists of one database and at least one or more SAP instances (sometimes called application servers). One SAP Instance is defined by having exactly one instance profile. The instance profiles can usually be found in the directory /sapmnt/SID/profile. Each instance must be configured as it\'s own resource in the cluster configuration.\nThe resource agent supports the following SAP versions:\n- SAP WebAS ABAP Release 6.20 - 7.40\n- SAP WebAS Java Release 6.40 - 7.40\n- SAP WebAS ABAP + Java Add-In Release 6.20 - 7.40 (Java is not monitored by the cluster in that case)\nWhen using a SAP Kernel 6.40 please check and implement the actions from the section "Manual postprocessing" from SAP note 995116 (http://sdn.sap.com).\nOther versions may also work with this agent, but have not been verified.\n\nAll operations of the SAPInstance resource agent are done by using the startup framework called SAP Management Console or sapstartsrv that was introduced with SAP kernel release 6.40. Find more information about the SAP Management Console in SAP note 1014480. Using this framework defines a clear interface for the Heartbeat cluster, how it sees the SAP system. The options for monitoring the SAP system are also much better than other methods like just watching the ps command for running processes or doing some pings to the application. sapstartsrv uses SOAP messages to request the status of running SAP processes. Therefore it can actually ask a process itself what it\'s status is, independent from other problems that might exist at the same time.\n\nsapstartsrv knows 4 status colours:\n- GREEN   = everything is fine\n- YELLOW  = something is wrong, but the service is still working\n- RED     = the service does not work\n- GRAY    = the service has not been started\n\nThe SAPInstance resource agent will interpret GREEN and YELLOW as OK. That means that minor problems will not be reported to the Heartbeat cluster. This prevents the cluster from doing an unwanted failover.\nThe statuses RED and GRAY are reported as NOT_RUNNING to the cluster. Depending on the status the cluster expects from the resource, it will do a restart, failover or just nothing.',

This is useful to resolve timing problems with e.g. the J2EE-Addin instance.Usually the resource agent waits until all services are started and the SAP Management Console reports a GREEN status. A double stack installation (ABAP + Java AddIn) consists of an ABAP dispatcher and a JAVA instance. Normally the start of the JAVA instance takes much longer than the start of the ABAP instance. For a JAVA Instance you may need to configure a much higher timeout for the start operation of the resource in Heartbeat. The disadvantage here is, that the discovery of a failed start by the cluster takes longer. Somebody might say: For me it is important, that the ABAP instance is up and running. A failure of the JAVA instance shall not cause a failover of the SAP instance.\nActually the SAP MC reports a YELLOW status, if the JAVA instance of a double stack system fails. From the resource agent point of view YELLOW means:everything is OK. Setting START_WAITTIME to a lower value determines the resource agent to check the status of the instance during a start operation after that time. As it would wait normally for a GREEN status, now it reports SUCCESS to the cluster in case of a YELLOW status already after the specified time.\n\nThat is only useful for double stack systems.',

It is not optimal to parse the debugging information, but\nI am not aware of any other way to find out about the IPC\ninformation. In case the format or wording of the trace report\nchanges, parsing might fail. There are some precautions, however,\nto prevent stepping on other peoples toes. There is also a\ndumpinstipc option which will make us print the IPC objects which\nbelong to the instance. Use it to see if we parse the trace file\ncorrectly.\n\nThree settings are possible:\n\n- none: don\'t mess with IPC and hope for the best (beware: you\'ll\n  probably be out of luck, sooner or later)\n- instance: try to figure out the IPC stuff which belongs to the\n  instance and remove only those (default; should be safe)\n- orauser: remove all IPC belonging to the user which runs the\n  instance (don\'t use this if you run more than one instance as same\n  user or if other apps running as this user use IPC)\n\nThe default setting "instance" should be safe to use, but in that\ncase we cannot guarantee that the instance will start. In case IPC\nobjects were already left around, because, for instance, someone\nmercilessly killing Oracle processes, there is no way any more to\nfind out which IPC objects should be removed. In that case, human\nintervention is necessary, and probably _all_ instances running as\nsame user will have to be stopped. The third setting, "orauser",\nguarantees IPC objects removal, but it does that based only on IPC\nobjects ownership, so you should use that only if every instance\nruns as separate user.\n\nPlease report any problems.
